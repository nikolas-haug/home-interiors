This web application is designed to facilitate customer engagement for the small business owner. In this particular instance, the products advertised are customized doors, kitchen cabinets, and wood flooring. Considering the budget restraints that clients might have, this app allows the user to make detailed selections from a wide variety of prodcuts in each category, storing their choices, and the accumulated price of these selections, in an authenticated user package for later scrutinization. Users can then udate and delete the selected items in their package as they compare it with their overall budget.
